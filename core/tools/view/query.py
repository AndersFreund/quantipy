def set_fullname(pos, method_name, relation, rel_to, weights, view_name):
    '''
    Sets the view's fullname: the fullname is the key for the view 
    under which it can be queried from the stack. It differs from the short view_name
    that can be chosen arbitrarily by the user by pre-fixing systematic information from
    kwargs parameters. The naming convention is as follows:
    
    pos|method_name|relation|rel_to|weights|view_name
    
    pos:            position of the view method result given the Link defintion
    method_name:    name of the originating method
    relation:       relationship of the calculation given the Link's x and y codes 
    rel_to:         indicates wether the calculation is in absolute terms 
                    or relative to another view
    weights:        the name of the weight (if any)
    view_name:      the short name of the view

    Examples
    --------
    x|frequency|||weight|counts
    pos:            results sits on the x axis
    method_name:    freq
    relation:       empty; the calculation is for x value TO y value
    rel_to:         empty; the calculation is not relative to anything, absolute counts
    weights:        the name of the weight variable has been "weight"
    counts:         short-name for the counts aggregation

    x|frequency||y|weight|c%
    pos:            results sits on the x axis
    method_name:    freq
    relation:       empty; the calculation is for x value TO y value
    rel_to:         the calculation is expressed relative to the y axis (the column base)
    weights:        the name of the weight variable has been "weight"
    c%:             short-name for the column percentage view

    x|means|x:y||weight|cMean
    pos:            results sits on the x axis
    method_name:    means
    relation:       calculation of x FOR EACH y value
    rel_to:         empty: the mean is not relative to anything
    weights:        the name of the weight variable has been "weight"
    cMean:          short-name for the column mean
